# Name Generator
Randomly generate a name. (Not necessarily a practical name :o )

# Program
## names.py
Names is a file that contains all the first names for both male and females, as well as last names.
## index.py
Index is the main program built with this pusedo code:
```
# Ask for male or female GENDER

# grab random first name FIRST

# grab random last name LAST

# \n\n
# print name with color
# \n\n

# ask them if they want to play again

# if no then say enter to exit
```

# Acknowledgements
* Idea came from a python book (Impractical Python Projects).
  - However, the code is mine.
